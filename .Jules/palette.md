## 2025-02-18 - RTL Spacing Pattern
**Learning:** This application relies on `tailwindcss-rtl` for Arabic support. Standard margin classes like `mr-2`/`ml-2` should be avoided in favor of logical properties `me-2`/`ms-2` to ensure correct spacing in RTL layouts.
**Action:** Always verify component spacing in RTL mode and use logical properties for directional spacing.
